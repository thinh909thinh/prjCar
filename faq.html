                <h3>
                    How much does car repair cost?</h3>
                <p class="read-more-wrap">It depends. If you drive a newer vehicle, your vehicle warranty will typically cover any car defects at no cost to you. You’re usually responsible for maintenance items like oil changes and tune ups unless you buy a car where the automaker
                    throws in complimentary maintenance for the first few years. Of course, some <span class="read-more-target">warranties last longer than others. If you purchased an extended warranty, some repairs are covered for the specified number of years or miles in your contract.
        
                If a warranty doesn’t cover a car repair or if your older vehicle isn’t under warranty any longer, you can always estimate what car repairs cost using our auto repair pricing tool.</span></p>

                <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-2" />
                <h3>How do I estimate car repairs?</h3>
                <p class="read-more-wrap">Estimating repair costs using our tool is the best and easiest way to know how much you can expect to pay, based on what others have paid. For example, suppose your vehicle’s fuel filter needs replacing. In that case, the tool will pull
                    up pricing in your local area represented as a Fair Repair Range, including parts and labor. <span class="read-more-target">The Fair Repair Range is Kelley Blue Book’s estimate of what you can reasonably expect to pay at a dealership.</span></p>

            <div>

                <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-3" />
                <h3>Do you pay before or after car repair?</h3>
                <p class="read-more-wrap">Most car repairs start as estimates, so you’ll get a sense of the cost before you agree to the repair. Then, in most cases, you don’t pay anything to the auto repair shop or dealership until the work is complete and you see the final bill.
                    However, for major body work some repair shops may require money up front.<span class="read-more-target"></span></p>

            <div>

                <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-4" />
                <h3>Can I make monthly payments on car repair?</h3>
                <p class="read-more-wrap">Yes. If you need financing for an auto repair, you can discuss the terms with the repair shop or your lender and work out monthly payments to pay for the work on your car. Be sure to ask about the interest rate because sometimes it can
                    be higher than a low-interest credit card. It’s far more likely that a dealership or<span class="read-more-target">larger repair shop will offer this option. If you bring your car to “Joe’s Garage” around the corner, Joe probably will not offer a payment plan.</span></p>

                <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-5" />
                <h3>Can you negotiate car repair costs?</h3>
                <p class="read-more-wrap">Yes, it’s possible. You can try to negotiate your auto repair costs, but there’s no guarantee. Once you know the estimated range of a typical repair for your vehicle using our car repair tool, you equip yourself with knowledge of the costs.
                    While fixed costs may not be negotiable, such as the price for the car part,<span class="read-more-target">dealerships and car repair shops will sometimes offer a break. Keep in mind that even though it might seem like there’s wiggle room in the labor costs, those amounts are usually pretty fixed too. You can also search the internet for available coupons. If it’s a common repair or maintenance item, like an oil change, new brakes or tune up, you can often find a promotion or coupon. And if you’re a regular customer at the same dealer or shop, ask for a loyalty discount. They’ll want to keep you coming back.</span></p>

                <h3>How can I reduce my auto repair costs?</h3>
                <p class="read-more-wrap">The best way to keep your car repair costs low is to keep up with regular maintenance on your vehicle. That includes getting oil changes at regular intervals, rotating your car tires, keeping them properly inflated, and more. Check your
                    owner’s manual to stay on top of your vehicle’s maintenance schedule. You can also<span class="read-more-target">reduce expenses for auto repairs by obtaining several quotes for non-emergency repairs and asking about discounts and coupons. That way, you can choose the quote that works best for you and your budget.</span></p>
